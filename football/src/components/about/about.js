                    <h1>About the <span>World Cup</span></h1>
                    <p>The FIFA World Cup, often simply called the World Cup, is an international association football competition contested by the senior men's 
                        national teams of the members of the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), the sport's global governing body. 
                        The championship has been awarded every four years since the inaugural tournament in 1930. The current champion is France, which 
                        won its second title at the 2018 tournament in Russia.The current format involves a qualification phase, which takes place over the preceding three years, 
                        to determine which teams qualify for the tournament phase.</p>
                        <p>In the tournament phase, 32 teams, including the automatically qualifying host nation(s), 
                        compete for the title at venues within the host nation(s) over about a month.17 countries have hosted the World Cup. 
                        Brazil, France, Italy, Germany, and Mexico have each hosted twice, while Uruguay, Switzerland, Sweden, Chile, England, Argentina, Spain, the United States, 
                        Japan and South Korea (jointly), South Africa, and Russia have each hosted once. Qatar will host the 2022 tournament, and 2026 will be jointly hosted by Canada, 
                        the United States, and Mexico, which will give Mexico the distinction of being the first country to host games in three World Cups. </p>
